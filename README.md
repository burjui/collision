This is an experiment in particle system simulation.
Currently uses 4th order Leapfrog integrator with Yoshida coefficients and preserves momentum on collisions if `restitution_coefficient = 1` (see config.toml). Runs on CPU, can use OpenCL for Leapfrog (collisions â€” not yet). Rendering is done on GPU using [`vello`](https://github.com/linebender/vello). Features a fairly good grid implementation, performance-wise.

PRs and discussions are welcome. Beware: since it's a hobby project, the code quality varies from squeaky clean to garbage, and the commit history is not very accurate in describing the changes.
